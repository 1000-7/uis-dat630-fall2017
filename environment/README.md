# Programming environment and tools

The course uses Python as a programming language.
It is possible to complete the assignments using any other programming language of choice. However, no support will be provided for any other programming language (hence, it is not recommended).


## Python

We use Python version 3.6. It is recommended to use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (ver 4.4.0).

  * Python 3.5 should work just as fine, nevertheless we have only tested our code with 3.6.

### Python packages

The following packages will be used. All of these are part of the Anaconda distribution (i.e., you don't have to install them separately if you installed Anaconda).

  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn


## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open source search engine.
See [this page](Elasticsearch.md) for installation and usage.

  * You need to [install the Python client](Elasticsearch.md#from-python)!


## Jupyter

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to run code interactively within a browser, along with visualizations, equations, and explanatory text.

Jupyter is also part of the Anaconda distribution. (If you're a Python pro and want to install it using pip, see [this page](http://jupyter.org/install.html).)

To start Jupyter, go to the command line, change to the directory that contains the notebooks, then type `jupyter notebook`.


## Test

Download the [Environment_test](Environment_test.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for testing if everything works.

  * Click "raw" to download it. Make sure the extension is `.ipynb`
  * Go to the folder where you downloaded the file and type `jupyter notebook`


## Notes for Windows

  * For running `jupyter notebook` and `pip` on Windows, you might need to use the "Anaconda Prompt" instead of the standard command line (cmd). You can find the Anaconda Prompt in your start menu.
